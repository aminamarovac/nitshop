In React.js,a component is a piece of code thar represents a part of a user interface.
 It can be a class component or a funtional component.
 Class component is a js class that extends React.Component class,while a functional component is  a
 js function that returns only the React element.

 A Purecomeponent is a special type of component that is similar to a component,
 but with additional features or optimizations.
 When a component is a PureComeponent,React will do a shallow comaprsion of the props 
 and state before re-rendering the component.That means that if props and state have not changed,
 the component will not be re-rendering.This can lead to a perfomance boost in some cases,
 but if it's not used properly,it can lead to unexpected behaviour.

 Bottomline,a component is the most basic and most used for building
 a block in React and PureComeponent 
 is used when it needs some special optimizations.

 Props(properties) is a way for manipulating data and states.
 We can send data trough props and we can send data to parent
 trough props...

 Parent component is component wich is created.
 Child component is component wich is included in Parent component.
 Parent component can have more than one Child components.
 Child components can be also found in other components as children(prop).
 Children as a prop is a reserved name.
